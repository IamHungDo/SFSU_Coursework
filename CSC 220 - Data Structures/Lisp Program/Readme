CSC220 Programming Project #2
=============================
 
Due Date: 23:55pm, Thursday, 11/6/2014, upload SimpleLispExpressionEvaluator.java to ilearn

- You need to implement SimpleLispExpressionEvaluator.java which uses Java API Stack
  See project requirements in SimpleLispExpressionEvaluator.java

- Use PJ2_Test.java to test correctness of your program

- Compile programs (you are in directory containing Readme file):
	
  javac PJ2/*.java
  javac *.java

- Run programs (you are in directory containing Readme file):

  // Run main() method tests in SimpleLispExpressionEvaluator class
  java PJ2.SimpleLispExpressionEvaluator

  // Run main test program
  java PJ2_Test

- Bonus (20%): Implement GUI test program
  
  Talk to me before you start this part.
